            8/21 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>    This week was a good introduction to the class. We started with creating websites, then learned  
            about the engineering method and about safety. I realized today how strong safety goggles actually are. 
            On Thursday, we had our first challenge, which was to find a way to get a marble into a bucket from a certain 
            distance. We were only allowed PVC pipes that were cut in half to help use. The hard part of the challenge was to 
            coordinate the group and get everyone on the same page. Another difficulty was trying to get the marble in the 
            small bucket. Overall, it was very fun and interesting, and I look forward to more challenges like this in 
            future.

            8/28-9/1 Week 2 <br> This week we learned about the job of a mechanical engineer. I especially remember that their job is 
            estremely broad and can encompass many things. I want to become a roller coaster engineer so I thought that this was very 
            interesting. We also learned about some of the tools a mechanical engineer uses to help them design, like TinkerCaD. 
            We also got to use TinkerCaD and design our own Rube Goldberg project. The goal of the project is to find a way to pop a ballloon
            using a baseball. We only have a limited supply, so we have to be creative. I think it is very interesting, and I look forward to 
            doing more. I did not get to do the challenge this week  because I was not in class on Friday, I had my first cross country race 
            of the season.

            9/5-9/8 Week 3 <br> This week in Engineering, we finished our TinkerCaD designs. It was meant to help us with our design and sizing. We 
            to make the design to scale which is a little more difficult. I think the hardest part was trying to make it to scale and make the 
            sim work. Then, on Thursday, we started our build. We started by cutting out the bare skeleton of the first hill. Today was a 
            productive day because we finally started building and we saw everyones strength and weaknesses. My job was to make sure all of the 
            materials for our group was there and that it returned to its place when we finished for the day. Over the weekend, I am going to 
            look at the TinkerCaD and figure out ways to make the process easier.

            9/11-9/15 Week 4 <br> This week was all about building. Using the TinkerCaD design, we made our Rube Goldberg Prject. That hardest 
            of the building process was trying to fix the little mistakes that we made. Everything is so technical, and that caused even the
            smallest error in placement to cause the entire project to not work. We especially had trouble working the seesaw, which was always 
            sending the baseball in the wrong direction. I really enjoyed making the structure, because it was very gratifying knowing that 
            the hard work we put in to the design payed off. Me and Liam did a good job of leading and telling the other members of our group
            to do to stay on task. I am very happy with how it turned out. The video of the final project is below. I think that it is very good.

            9/18-9/21 Week 5 <br> This week was pretty chill. On Monday, the groups that still needed to test their projects finished up, while
            everyone else got to polish up their websites. I am trying to find a way to make different pages and hopefully sort these entries 
            by month and semester. But since I never coded before, I am happy with what there is now. On Tuesday, we had another challenge, and
            the purpose was to make a paper boat that help weight. The goal was to make it float for 5 minutes and I am happy to say mine 
            succeeded. If I could change anything, I would have added more weight, because I think that the boat could have held more.
            The other challenge we had was to design a paper E with measurements planned out, then create somebody else's. The 
            person I got did very well, and I think that I did well too. This really made me learn about how important details are  On Thursday, we learned about computer engineering and what they do.
            I do not think that I would be very interested by it. COmputers and things like electrical engineering do not interest me that much.

            9/25-9/29 Week 6 <br> This week was very busy. On Monday, we started an introduction to computer engineering. It was interesting, although
            I wounln't really want to do it. The areas that it encompasses include everything with computers, and combines math to create new things.
            Something that I found interesting was Moore's Law, because while I always knew that computers and electronics were getting more advanced,
            I didn't know that it was by that much. The next day we dissected a computer. I had a lot of fun doing that because it was really interesting
            seeing how and where parts of a computer went. The thing I found most difficult was remembering the jobs and locations of many parts. That
            caused a little bit of difficulty on Thursday because we had to label a computer. But Liam helped me a lot so I was able to finish. The pictures
            are of me and Liam dissecting the computer.

            10/2-10/6 Week 7 <br> The theme of this week in class was bioengineering. It's another field of engineering that I find a little interesting
            but is not something that I think I would want to do. The most interesting part of it was the prosthetics that bioengineering can make, like
            the artificial hearts and arms. So as the challenge for that week, we made an prosthetic hand out of cardboard. Me and Liam both knew what we 
            wanted it to look like, and after getting the bare skeleton of the and made, and being able to work, we added some more details. We knew that 
            the fingers needed to be longer than a human finger so that it would be able to grip around an entire water bottle. We also knew that the fingers
            needed to have joints so that it could bend and reach around it as well. I think that the hardest part was getting all the string that we used
            as the pull system to move the fingers all even was hard to put together because if one string was out of place, the entire hand would be out of 
            proportion. In the end, we managed to get the hand to lift up the bottle and we even made it look good by adding a handle.

            10/0-10/13 Week 8 <br> This week in class we learned all about Aerospace Engineering. I had a little bit of a background in this because
            my cousins both work in Aeronautical Engineering and it was actually pretty interesting. But one thing that I did not know was the difference between
            Aeronautical and Astronomical engineering was. I didn't know that aeronautical only dealt with things inside the atmosphere, and astro was everything
            not in the atmosphere. If I were to go into this field, I think that Aeronautical engineering would be what I would gravitate to because I find 
            the making of planes and jets interesting. It's also what my cousins do, so they could help me when I need it. The next time we met was to do our 
            project. The project was to make a bottle rocket. To plan it, we make TinkerCaD designs to have as a guide. My design it pretty simple with four fins
            and a cone top.

        <p>
            10/16-10/20 Week 9 <br> This week we continued our learning of Aerospace Engineering. We built our rockets and tested them. The design was very much
            like my TinkerCaD, having 3 curved fins and a long cone. During our testing,when our rocket went off, it didn't go very far. We put in about 2.5 inches
            of water and had our pressure to 60 psi. When it went off, it had good takeoff, and then spun in the air a lot. If I could change the design, I would have
            shortened the cone and straightened out the wings. I also would have made the wings a little smaller because I think that it could have made
            it a little more stable. I also think that if I made the back a little heavier, it would have been more stable. I think that the amount of pressure 
            was good, but I needed a little less water to slow it down. The video of the attempt is below.

            10/23-10/27 Week 10 <br> This week I learned about environmental engineering, its purposes, uses and challenges. The most interesting part of this 
            week was seeing what environmental engineering encompases. For example, I did not realize that there were different types of water, like black, grey and
            white. Personally, I only saw water as clean and dirty, with there not being a middle ground of somewhat dirty and somewhat clean. The project that 
            we did was taking black dirty water and trying to purify it to be as clean as possible. We had rocks, sand, cotten balls, and pebbles to use. Me and 
            Andrew put the cotton balls at the bottom to try and be a final filter, the sand on top of that to act as purifier, and the pebbles and rocks to take out 
            the big chunks of wood and dirt. It worked pretty well, only having a yellow coloration. I think that to make it better, we should've taken out the 
            filtered wood on the top to not contaminate the rest of the water that we were trying to refilter. A picture of our filter is below.

        <p>
            10/30-11/3 Week 11 <br> This week we learned about electrical engineering. I found it very interesting but a little difficult. We learned about
            Ohm's Law, which explains the relationship between current, voltage and resistance. This was the easiest part of the week, because it was just 
            plugging in numbers to a formula, which makes a lot of sense to me. Then we went on TinkerCad to learn about circuits and how to make a light
            turn on. This was definently the hardest part of the week, because I didn't really get how a breadboard works adn trying to ground the resistors
            and LEDs was confusing. I think that once I got the difference between series and parallel, it made more sense. Also, resistors and diodes were 
            a little hard to understand and get how to connect them all on the breadboard. I am excited to use a real circuit, because I think that it will make 
            more sense. I think that I probably wouldn't want to pursue this field, but I find it very interesting on how electricity works.

            11/6-11/10 Week 12 <br> Building week. This week we got to use real circuits and breadboards, and got to turn on some LED lights. I was really 
            thankful for the TinkerCaD because that really helped me to figure out how to put the wires in. I got to turn on 1, 2, and 3 LEDs at once and 
            I was very proud when I got it to work. I think that once I figured out the terms and how to read the plan, it was pretty easy. Also once I 
            figured out the multimeter and was able to read voltage, it was very rewarding to see the hard work go to fruition. The hardest part about this
            week was getting the code to work to try and get the lights to blink. We have another shot at it next week so I am looking forward to that.

            11/13-11/17 Week 13 <br> We have been gifted with a new type of engineering. Fun. This week was business engineering, which I think has been
            the most boring so far. I have nothing against it, but it just seems like a lot of logistics and people pleasing, which is not really what
            I like to do. But what was interesting was marketing and how to get people to buy your prodect. I think that it would be kinda cool to see 
            if I can get people to buy a product that I make. But by far the most interesting was the trolley problem and the ethical part. I wouldn't 
            know what to chose because sometimes none of the available answers are the best or right decision, so chosing the answer that you feel is best.
            For the project, it is Shark Tank pitch. The rough idea that we are think of is a edible waffle cone holder so that the ice cream doesn't drip 
            onto your hand. The picture is the reusable version, so just imagine edible.

            11/27-12/1 Week 14 <br> We countinued wourking on our Shark Tank Pitches. My group decided to change the invention, and we chose to make the 
            Thermo Spoon, it is a spoon that if you microwave, will heat up. This allows you to reheat a drink or soup without microwaving it. It seems 
            repetitive, but having heated a drink in the microwave myself, I can say that it does not have nearly the same taste. I looked into the 
            manufacturing of metal spoons to see how much they are made, and then sold for. It was a little difficult because while manufacturing price
            is easy to find, finding the price for an individual metal spoon is harder, becaause they are mostly sold in dining sets. My personal favorite
            presentation to watch was the second measuring tool presentation. This was the one with the two pieces that presented Thursday, I forgot the name.
