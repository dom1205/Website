            8/24/23 - This week was a good introduction to the class. We started with creating websites, then learned <br> 
            about the engineering method and about safety. I realized today how strong safety goggles actually are. <br>
            On Friday, we had our first challenge, which was to find a way to get a marble into a bucket from a certain <br>
            distance. We were only allowed PVC pipes that were cut in half to help use. THe hard part of the challenge was to <br>
            coordinate the group and get everyone on the same page. Another difficulty was trying to get the marble in the <br>
            small bucket. Overall, it was very fun and interesting, and I look forward to more challenges like this in <br>
            future.
