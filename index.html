            8/21 - 8/24 Week 1 <br>    This week was a good introduction to the class. We started with creating websites, then learned  
            about the engineering method and about safety. I realized today how strong safety goggles actually are. 
            On Thursday, we had our first challenge, which was to find a way to get a marble into a bucket from a certain 
            distance. We were only allowed PVC pipes that were cut in half to help use. The hard part of the challenge was to 
            coordinate the group and get everyone on the same page. Another difficulty was trying to get the marble in the 
            small bucket. Overall, it was very fun and interesting, and I look forward to more challenges like this in 
            future.

            8/28-9/1 Week 2 <br> This week we learned about the job of a mechanical engineer. I especially remember that their job is 
            estremely broad and can encompass many things. I want to become a roller coaster engineer so I thought that this was very 
            <br> interesting. We also learned about some of the tools a mechanical engineer uses to help them design, like TinkerCaD. 
            We also got to use TinkerCaD and design our own Rube Goldberg project. The goal of the project is to find a way to pop a ballloon
            using a baseball. We only have a limited supply, so we have to be creative. I think it is very interesting, and I look forward to 
            doing more. I did not get to do the challenge this week  because I was not in class on Friday, I had my first cross country race 
            of the season.

            9/5-9/8 Week 3 <br> This in Engineering, we finished our TinkerCaD designs. It was meant to help us with our design and sizing. We 
            to make the design to scale which is a little more difficult. I think the hardest part was trying to make it to scale and make the 
            sim work. Then, on Thursday, we started our build. We started by cutting out the bare skeleton of the first hill. Today was a 
            productive day because we finally started building and we saw everyones strength and weaknesses. My job was to make sure all of the 
            materials for our group was there and that it returned to its place when we finished for the day. Over the weekend, I am going to 
            look at the TinkerCaD and figure out ways to make the process easier.
