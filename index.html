            8/21/23 - 8/24 <br> This week was a good introduction to the class. We started with creating websites, then learned <br> 
            about the engineering method and about safety. I realized today how strong safety goggles actually are. 
            On Thursday, we had our first challenge, which was to find a way to get a marble into a bucket from a certain <br>
            distance. We were only allowed PVC pipes that were cut in half to help use. THe hard part of the challenge was to 
            coordinate the group and get everyone on the same page. Another difficulty was trying to get the marble in the <br>
            small bucket. Overall, it was very fun and interesting, and I look forward to more challenges like this in 
            future.
